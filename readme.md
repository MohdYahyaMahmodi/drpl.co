## Open-Source Peer-to-Peer File Sharing for All Devices

**drpl.co** is a free, open-source file sharing solution that works across all platforms without requiring apps, accounts, or device-specific limitations. Share files instantly between any devices on the same network.

Visit the live site: [https://drpl.co](https://drpl.co)

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on all major operating systems and devices
- **No Installation Required**: Just open the website in your browser
- **No Account Needed**: No sign-ups, no tracking
- **Local Network Only**: Files transfer directly between devices on the same network
- **End-to-End Privacy**: Files are never uploaded to external servers
- **No File Size Limits**: Send any file type of any size
- **Text Messaging**: Send quick text messages along with files
- **Simplified Interface**: Clean, intuitive design that works on mobile and desktop

## How It Works

drpl.co uses WebRTC (with WebSocket fallback) to establish direct connections between devices on the same network. When you open drpl.co in your browser, the server assigns you a unique identifier and a friendly display name. Other devices on your network running drpl.co will automatically appear, allowing direct file transfers.

### Technical Details

- **Server Component**: Lightweight Node.js server provides signaling to establish peer connections
- **WebRTC Data Channels**: Used for peer-to-peer data transfer when supported by the browser
- **WebSocket Fallback**: Ensures compatibility with all browsers
- **Progressive Web App**: Can be installed on mobile devices
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to all screen sizes
- **Local Discovery**: Devices find each other through the signaling server

### Privacy & Security

drpl.co is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- Files transfer directly between devices, never passing through our servers
- No analytics or tracking scripts
- No data collection
- No accounts or login requirements
- All code is open source and can be self-hosted

## Getting Started

### Using the Public Service

1. Open [https://drpl.co](https://drpl.co) on two or more devices connected to the same network
2. You'll see other devices appear automatically in the interface
3. Click on a device to connect and choose to send files or messages
4. Select files or type your message
5. The recipient will receive a notification and can download the files or view messages

### Local Development Setup

To run drpl.co locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MohdYahyaMahmodi/drpl.co.git
   cd drpl.co
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3002` in your browser

5. For local testing with multiple devices, make sure they can reach your development machine via your local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3002`)

## Self-Hosting

drpl.co can be easily self-hosted on your own server:

1. Clone the repository to your server
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Configure your web server (nginx, Apache, etc.) to proxy requests to the Node.js application
4. Start the server with PM2 or a similar process manager:
   ```
   pm2 start server.js --name drpl
   ```

### Self-Hosting with Docker

We provide a Dockerfile for easy containerization:

```
docker build -t drpl .
docker run -p 3002:3002 drpl
```
